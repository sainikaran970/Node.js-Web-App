ejs -> Embedded JavaScript templates

What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.


If you give end-users unfettered access to the EJS render method, you are using EJS in an inherently un-secure way. Please do not report security issues that stem from doing that.

EJS is effectively a JavaScript runtime. Its entire job is to execute JavaScript. If you run the EJS render method without checking the inputs yourself, you are responsible for the results.

In short, DO NOT submit 'vulnerabilities' that include this snippet of code:

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
 res.render('index', req.query);
});
